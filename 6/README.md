# Sum square difference
*Problem 6*

The sum of squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

$$1^2+2^2+\cdots+10^2=255$$

The square of sums of the first ten natural numbers is,

$$(1+2+\cdots+10)^2=55^2=3025$$

Hence the difference between the sum of squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of sums is $$3025-255=2640$$.

Find the difference between the sum of squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of sums.
